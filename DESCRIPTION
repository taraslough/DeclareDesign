Description: Tools for characterizing, diagnosing, and pre-registering research
    designs. This software provides a way for scholars to characterize research
    designs formally, and then to learn about their designs before conducting the
    study. This includes creating mock data and diagnosing the properties of the
    design. Finalized designs can be straightforwardly pre-registered with the
    package.
